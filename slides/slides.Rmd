.pull-left[
- **Version control** software

- Tracks *changes* to files, who made those changes, and *why*

- Enables sane management of complicated, evolving projects



  .center[
  #### Example **Repository**:
  
  !["four files with icons and the following filenames: data_raw.csv, fig1.png, analysis.R,   report.Rmd"](../images/ex_proj.png)
  ]
]
.pull-right[

#### Example Git Workflow:

1. You move code for figure from `analysis.R` to `report.Rmd` and delete `fig1.png`  

2. Save changes

3. Take a snapshot with a **commit**.  Must include message explaining changes!

.center[
  <img src="../images/ex_commit.png" 
       alt="four files with icons and the following filenames: data_raw.csv, fig1.png, analysis.R,   report.Rmd"/>
]
]

---
<img src="../images/git_logo.png" width="200"/>

So instead of this:
.pull-left[
![image of files named analysis_new.R, analysis_final.R, analysis_FINAL_FOR_REALZ.R, and analysis_EB_idea.R](../images/ex_messy.png)
]
.pull-right[
<img src ="../images/ex_oldcode.png"
     alt = "commented-out R code starting with '#OLD CODE, might not work'"/>
]

--

You have this:

.center[
![image of git commit history with commits "initial commit", "add summary table", "move fig1 code to report", "add linear model", "change to log-normal GLM"](../images/ex_hist.png)
]

---
<img src="../images/github_logo.png" width=250/>

.pull-left[
- Website for hosting version controlled code and interfacing with git
- Supports sharing and collaborating on code (and other text)
- Repositories can be public or private

#### Typical GitHub workflow:

1. Make **commits**
2. **Push** a series of **commits** to remote repository hosted on GitHub
5. Collaborators (or you on a different computer) can **pull** changes to get most up-to-date version of project

## Collaborating with GitHub

GitHub also has features that help manage multiple people editing files.

- **Branches** can be used to independently make changes, like each co-author editing their own copy of a manuscript

- **Pull Requests** are a *request* that changes made in a branch are *pulled* into the main branch

- When pull requests are made, there are opportunities to view and review the changes, request further edits, and to deal with conflicts (e.g. someone already edited a line in a different way)

# Context: why am I giving this talk?

---
### My git / GitHub journey

2017 — First ever commit.  Added function to query chemical IDs for flavors and aromas to the [`webchem` package](https://github.com/ropensci/webchem).   

--

2018 — Started using GitHub as a way to backup all my analyses

--

2019 — First time really using GitHub collaboratively. `webchem` maintainers invited me to apply for [R Consortium grant](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/awarded-projects/2019-group-2#webchem:+accessing+chemical+information+from+the+web) with them.

--

2020 — Started collaboration on manuscripts via GitHub: [`webchem` manuscript](https://github.com/EDiLD/webchem_paper) and [first postdoc paper](https://github.com/BrunaLab/HeliconiaDemography) written in R Markdown collaboratively via GitHub

--

2021 — Mentored [REU students](https://github.com/BrunaLab/REU-resources) remotely using GitHub to share and review code and data

--

2021 — [SORTEE conference](https://www.sortee.org/past/).  Started work on [collaborative manuscript]() with working title:
"Not just for programmers: A friendly guide on the versatility/benefits of GitHub for accelerating collaborative research in Ecology and Evolution"

.center[
My inspiration:
**"GitHub is great, but it could be even better with more buy-in from collaborators.  How can I lower barriers?"**

# Uses and Benefits of GitHub in Ecology

## Collaborative Data Analysis

Multiple people can be given permission to work on a single GitHub repository

**A possible workflow for getting feedback on R code:**

- I **push** R code to GitHub and ask Elizabeth to review it

- Elizabeth **clones** repository to her computer and runs the code

- Elizabeth adds some comments, fixes some mistakes, makes commits, **pushes** changes

- I then **pull** her changes and run updated code on my computer

--

More [complicated workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) that better manage conflicts exist, but are not strictly necessary

--

### This could be really useful for *remote* and *bi-coastal* labs doing a lot of modeling and data analysis!

---
## Interacting with Published R Code

- Many R packages are developed collaboratively on GitHub

- Some manuscripts share code on GitHub

- Report bugs with **Issues**

- Ask for help in **Discussions**

- Copy and edit code by **forking** repository

- Make contributions with **pull requests**

###Demo:

- Example R Package: https://github.com/lme4/lme4
- Example Discussions: https://github.com/easystats/performance/discussions
- Example manuscript code: https://github.com/weecology/white-etal-2012-ecology
- Example PR: https://github.com/bbolker/bbmle/pull/21

## Archiving Data and Code

- Journals increasingly requiring data (and code) to be archived

- GitHub alone not suitable for long-term archiving, but GitHub + Zotero is recommended ([Mislan et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2015.11.006))

- Archived code is more reliable and often easier to use than journal supplements

- Literally just flip a switch on Zenodo, then create a **release** on GitHub and the whole repository is archived and given a DOI.

## Websites

GitHub pages is a feature that will turn any .md or .html file on GitHub into a website with a URL

#### Uses from simple to complex:

- Single R Markdown report to send to advisor or collaborators (e.g. https://brunalab.github.io/heliconia-cmip/)

- Host an HTML-based presentation (like this one! https://aariq.github.io/github-for-ecologists/slides/slides.html)

- Summary of a project or manuscript (e.g. https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/)

- Website for a course (e.g. https://github.com/weecology/forecasting-course)

- Personal website (e.g. https://masonfidino.com/)

- Lab website (e.g. https://github.com/weecology/website)

## Manuscripts
.pull-left[
Although it's not really it's *intended* use, GitHub can be used effectively for collaborative writing.

Some caveats:

- git only tracks differences in *plain text*, so .docx files won't work well (markdown is an alternative)
- Not synchronous like Google Docs
- not as easy to add comments like in Word

Some benefits:
- sane management of conflicts
- centralized discussion and versioning
- everyone has access to most up-to-date version

#### Markdown Example:

```
# Heading
## Subheading
```
#### Heading
##### Subheading

```
**bold**, *italics*
```

**bold**, *italics*

```
$y = \alpha_0 + \beta_1 x_1$
```

$y = \alpha_0 + \beta_1 x_1$
